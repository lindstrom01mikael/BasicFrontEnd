### Assignment

Your assignment is to build a basic HTML page structure, for use in later exercises. Don’t focus at all on styling at this point – only make the HTML elements and their contents.

### Required Features:

- The page should be encoded using the UTF-8 character set
- A page title, defined in the head element.
- A header element containing a heading (h1) with the page name. It should also have a nav element with an unordered list of at least 3 links
- A container element for the main content of the page, containing a heading (h2), a paragraph of text and two article elements. Each should have filler text - at least 2 paragraphs each. One should have an image (use lorempixel.com)
- A aside element, containing a heading (h2) and an unordered list of nations, each list item containing an ordered list of the nation’s three biggest cities
- A footer element, containing a copyright symbol and your name

## Part 2: Stylesheet

### Subjects Covered:

- CSS
- Selectors
- Styling Rules

### Assignment

In this assignment, you will take the HTML fundamentals page, and style it using CSS. Try to avoid making changes to the HTML itself.

### Required Features:

- All text on the page should use a sans-serif font family.
- The page should be 1024 pixels wide, and be centered on the page, with equal margins to the left and right.
- Give the page the appearance of the example placed in picture below, using only your own CSS code.
- (The gray boxes show where elements should be positioned – you do not need them to appear as gray boxes on the page)

### Code Requirements:

- All the CSS code should come from the same file and be linked into the HTML file through a link tag – there should be no style tags or style attributes in the HTML file at all.

#### Optional:

- The second paragraph of the first article element should be written in bold text, with a blue text color.
- In the unordered list in the side content, items should appear in alternating colors (green and red, as a suggestion).
